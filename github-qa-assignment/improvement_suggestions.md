### 1. **Improve API Error Consistency and Verbosity**

* **Issue**: Some error responses (like 422 or 403) lack sufficient detail to understand the root cause, especially for beginners.
* **Suggestion**: Include a more verbose `message`, clear `reason`, and examples of what causes the error. Add `hint` fields in the JSON response.

---

### 2. **Unify UI Element Identifiers for Automation and Accessibility**

* **Issue**: Many UI elements lack stable `id`, `name`, or `data-testid` attributes, making automation and accessibility inconsistent.
* **Suggestion**: Standardize `data-testid` across major UI components (buttons, fields, tabs) to improve accessibility tools and test automation reliability.

---

### 3. **Improve First-Time User Guidance for Pull Requests and Issues**

* **Issue**: The "New Pull Request" and "New Issue" workflows assume prior knowledge; first-time users may get confused by base vs compare, or issue templates.
* **Suggestion**: Include contextual tooltips or guided walk-throughs for new users during their first PR or issue creation experience.

---

### 4. **Display Real-Time API Rate Limits in the UI**

* **Issue**: API rate limit feedback is only in headers, and there's no direct UI warning when nearing the limit.
* **Suggestion**: Surface the remaining rate limit in developer-focused UI areas (e.g., GitHub Actions, API Tokens page).

---

### 5. **Reduce JavaScript-Driven Latency in Form Interactions**

* **Issue**: Forms like issue creation and PR submission often experience 1–2 second delays in rendering dropdowns (labels, assignees).
* **Suggestion**: Optimize frontend rendering using lighter components or preload cache of common metadata (labels, collaborators) to reduce lag.

---

### 6. **Clarify Branch Comparison Logic in PR Workflow**

* **Issue**: When branches have no differences or an existing PR, GitHub shows ambiguous messages like “There isn’t anything to compare.”
* **Suggestion**: Show a more descriptive explanation, e.g., “These branches have already been merged,” or “A PR already exists from X to Y.”

---

### 7. **Strengthen API Token Access Controls**

* **Issue**: Fine-grained PATs sometimes return `403` even with seemingly correct scopes, without clearly identifying the missing permission.
* **Suggestion**: Include `required_scope` or `missing_permission` in error responses, and add a permission simulator tool in the UI for PATs.
